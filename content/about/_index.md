# About

Hi! I am Kirill, a software engineer from New Zealand. Currently, I am a Java engineer @ [Str√∂er Labs](https://jobs.stroeer-labs.com/new-zealand/).
Welcome to my blog, hopefully you will find it interesting. I am not exactly sure what this blog will cover, but I think it will mainly be a collection
of my thoughts that I wish to share and that I think others will enjoy. I will mostly be focussing on software engineering topics, but I might sprinkle some
other topics in too.

If you wish to get in contact, email me here - [kirillovk@yahoo.co.nz](mailto:kirillovk@yahoo.co.nz)
